down n She caught the eye of an oil man dancing n One summer night in a dime store dress n She had the looks he had the mansion n And you can figure out the rest n It was all roses dripping in diamonds n Sipping on champagne n She was all uptown wearing that white gown n Taking his last name n She could hear those church bells ringing ringing n And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing n Fold your hands and close your eyes n Yeah it s all gonna be alright n And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing n Yeah they re ringing n Jenny was hosting Junior League parties n And having dinner at the country club n Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie n But Ken was always getting way too drunk n Saturday night after a few too many n He came home ready to fight n And all his money could never save Jenny n From the devil living in his eyes n It was all bruises covered in makeup n Dark sunglasses n And that next morning sitting in the back pew n Praying with the baptist n She could hear those church bells ringing ringing n And up in the loft that whole choir singing singing n Fold your hands and close your eyes n Yeah it s all gonna be alright n You just listen to the church bells ringing ringing n Yeah they re ringing n Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey n No law man was ever gonna find n And how he died is still a mystery n But he hit a woman for the very last time n She could hear those church bells ringing ringing n Standing there in a black dress singing singing n Fold your hands and close your eyes n Yeah it s all gonna be alright n And just listen to the church bells ringing ringing n Yeah they re ringing n n That lipstick on your collar well it ain t my shade of pink n n And I can tell by the smell of that perfume n It s like forty dollars too cheap n n And there s a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread n Well you drink beer and whiskey boy and you know I don t drink red n n Found it over in the corner n Wadded up on the bedroom floor n n You shoulda hid it in the closet n You shoulda burned it you shoulda lost it n Now I ma have to hang you out to dry dry dry n n Clothespin all your secrets to the line line line n n Leave em blowing in the wind just say goodbye to you n n All those midnights sneaking in n I m late again oh I m so sorry n n All the Ajax in the world ain t gonna clean your dirty laundry n n If the neighbors get to asking I won t cover nothing up n I ll tell em every little detail how you drug me through the mud n n I m gonna string up your old button down and slide it on the porch n n Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin on my door n n Yeah I ma have to hang you out to dry dry dry n n Clothespin all your secrets to the line line line n n Leave em blowing in the wind just say goodbye to you n n All those midnights sneaking in n I m late again oh I m so sorry n n All the Ajax in the world ain t gonna clean your dirty laundry n n Found it over in

n Sometimes our happiness is captured n Somehow our time and place stand still n Love lives on inside our hearts and always will n Minutes turn to hours days to years and gone n But when all else has been forgotten n Still our song lives on n Maybe some moments weren t so perfect n Maybe some memories not so sweet n But we have to know some bad times n Or our lives are incomplete n Then when our shadows overtake us n Just when we feel our hope is gone n We ll hear our song and know once more n Our love lives on n n How does a moment last forever n How does our happiness endure n Through the darkest of our troubles n Love is beauty love is pure n Love pays no mind to desolation n It flows like a river through the soul n Protects perceives and perseveres n And makes us whole n Minutes turn to hours days to years then gone n But when all else has been forgotten n Still our song lives on n How does a moment last forever n When our song lives on n by OversG n You don t want zero problems

silence n In restless dreams I walk alone n Narrow streets of cobble stone n Neath the halo of a street lamp n I turned my collar to the cold and damp n When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light n That split the night n And touched the sound of silence n And in the naked night I saw n Ten thousand people maybe more n People talking without speaking n People hearing without listening n People writing songs that voices never share n And no one dare disturb the sound of silence n Fool said I you do not know n Silence like a cancer grows n Hear my words that I might teach you n Take my arms that I might reach you n But my words like silent rain drops fell n And echoed in the wells of silence n And the people bow and prayed n To the neon God they made n And the sign flash out its warning n In the words that it was forming n And the sign said n The words of the prophers are written the subway walls n And tenement halls n And whispered in the sounds of silence n by

at down those n Country lanes n Singing to Tiny Dancer n And I miss the way you made me feel n It s real we watched the sunset n Over the castle on the hill n n Fifteen years old n And smoking hand rolled cigarettes n Running from the law through the backfields n And getting drunk with my friends n Had my first kiss on a Friday night n I don t reckon that I did it right n But I was younger then n Take me back to when n We found weekend jobs when we got paid n We d buy cheap spirits and drink them straight n Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long n Oh how we ve grown n I can t wait

the castle on the hill n Over the castle on the hill n n One friend left to sell clothes n One works down by the coast n One had two kids but lives alone n One s brother overdosed n One s already on his second wife n One s just barely getting by n But these people raised me n And I can t wait to go home n And I m on my way n I still remember these old n Country lanes n When we did not know the answers n And I miss the way you made me feel n It s real we watched the sunset n Over the castle on the hill n Over the castle on the hill n Over the castle on the hill n n You are the one girl n You

alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie n I can t tell you what it really is n I can only tell you what it feels like n And right now there s a steel knife in my windpipe n I can t breathe but I still fight while I can fight n As long as the wrong feels right it s like I m in flight n High off the love drunk from my hate n It s like I m huffing paint and I love her the more i

consequences deadly n Can t visualize myself as nothing but a criminal n Control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal n Cause young s is hard headed they letting off n Full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause n Ain t no coming back family dressed in black n Plus it s hot now the cops outside it s hard to flip a pack n And my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me n Like I ain t the one who put them Jays on her feet n Like I ain t out in the field like that n I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back n Despite the charges back to the wall I fight regardless Screaming the law my life is lawless n That s what you call it n Ain t got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven n This is hell and I don t mean that hyperbolic n I try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless n But these felonies be making life the hardest n Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet n Or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it n That s why I write this sonnet n If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break n Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it n Let her know my life is on it n For your eyes n Let her know my life is on n For your eyes only n Hook For your eyes do you understand n For your eyes do you understand me n For your eyes do you

You re probably grown now so this song ll hit you n If you re hearing this unfortunately means that I m no longer with you n In the physical not even sure if I believe in God n But because you still alive n He got me praying that the spiritual is real n So I can be a part of you still my pops was killed too n So I know how part of you feels n Maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me n Life goes in cycles maybe you ll date a just like me n I hope not I m tired of spots n And fiends that smoke rocks I ve seen far too many s hopes rot n I m writing this because me and the devil had a dance n Now I see death around the corner apologizing in advance n Don t know if I ever had a chance n At a glance I m a failure addicted to pu ng paraphernalia n But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once n Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years n My Pops shot up drug related n Mama addicted n So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging n Blood was staining the concrete n Older s I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet n That slow money picked up the family business n By the age of thirteen six years later was handed sentence n Round the same time is when you came in this world n Me and your mama thinking what the we naming this girl n I told her Nina the prettiest name that I could think of n For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen n I was nineteen took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me n And now I fear it s too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me n I m living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me n And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand n Hook For your eyes do you understand n For your eyes do you

the cash running out n s don t know how to act in a drought n See baby girl I realized my definition of a real was skewed n My views misshaped by new mixtapes n That confirmed the t I learned in the streets was true n That real s don t speak when they beef with you n They just pull up on your street let the heat at you n And if a real hungry he gon eat your food n I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops n Ducking rules hugging blocks that don t love you n I pray you find a with goals and point of views n Much broader than the corner if not it s gon corner you n Into a box where your son don t even know his pops n And the cyclical nature of doing time continues n My worst fear is one day that you come home from school n and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news n I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon n And sadly if you re listening now it must mean it s true n But maybe there s a chance that it s not n And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels n And I can teach you this in person like I m teaching you to tie your own shoes n I love you and I hope to God I don t lose you n For your eyes

been dealing with lately he wasn t telling n I tried to pick his brains still he wasn t revealing n But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling n He said Jermaine I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing n When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me n I dealt with the repercussions of my actions n I know you tried to steer me way from that t n But that t was in my blood you know my life n I know your Momma send my love n In case I never get a chance to speak again n I won t forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib n That s the way I wished my family lived n But my granny crib was in the jects n I had to interject like what you talking bout is you getting at n He said Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions n But I ve been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side n I got a feeling I won t see tomorrow like the time I m living on is borrowed n With that said the only thing I m proud to say I was a father n Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready n And so I m leaving you this record for your eyes only don t you ever scratch or

ground where you abandoned things and n Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me n Six years old and you know he never walks away n He never asks for money he takes care of me n He loves me n Piece by piece he restored my faith n That a man can be kind and a father could stay n n And all of your words fall flat n I made something of myself and now you want to come back n n But your love it isn t free it has to be earned n n Back then I didn t have anything you needed so I was worthless n n But piece by piece he collected me n Up off the ground where you abandoned things and n Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me n Six years old and you know he never walks away n He never asks for money he takes care of me n Cause he loves me n Piece by piece he restored my faith n That a man can be kind and a father could stay n Piece by piece n Piece by piece n Piece by piece n Piece by piece n Piece by piece n Piece by piece n Piece by piece I fell far from the tree n I will never leave her like you left me n And she will never have to wonder her worth n Because unlike you I m going to put her first n And you know he ll never walk away n He ll never

in that sleepy town n He ll sit one day the lights are down n He ll see my face and think of how he used to know me n n Climb the hills I m reaching for the heights n And chasing all the lights that shine n And when they let you down n You ll get up off the ground n As morning rolls around n And it s another day of sun n n I hear them everyday n The rhythms in the canyons that will never fade away n The ballads In the barrooms left by those who came before n They say you gotta want it more n So I bang on every door n n And even when the answer s no n Or when my money s running low n The dusty mic and neon glow are all I need n n And some day as I sing the song n A small town kid will come along n That ll be the thing to push him on and he ll go n n Climb the hills I m reaching for the heights n And chasing all the lights that shine n And when they let you down n You ll get up off the ground n As morning rolls around n And it s another day of sun n n When they let you down n The
